							<p class="modal-content-about-me-p">Apprentice Software Developer</p>
							<p>Hi, I'm William. <br>
							I’m an Apprentice Software Developer at WeCan{Code}IT, an accelerated Software Development program that teaches Full Stack Java with focuses on test driven development. I first saw coding back in High School when it covered HTML and CSS then again in 2013 when I took an intro course to C++. Before coding, I served an honorable 4 years in the Marine Corps as an 0311 - Rifleman. It was while I was the Marines that I decided to start learning how to build my own Computer for gaming purposes. My first custom build was built around an AMD Phenom II X4 955 Black Edition Deneb Quad-Core 3.2 GHz processor.</p>
							<p>It wasn’t till last year, 2017, when I took some time off work to visit my Fiance in Vietnam that I researched coding bootcamps and discovered that WeCan{Code}IT took the Post 9/11 GI Bill so I applied and was accepted. I took this opportunity to continue to learn about the software side of computers and found happiness coding in Java while building my code through test driving and pair programming. </p>
							<p>Graduation is April 20th and I cannot wait to start my career in Software Development.</p>
