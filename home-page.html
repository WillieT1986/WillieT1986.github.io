								<h2>William R Thompson Jr</h2>
								<p>Apprentice Software Developer</p>
								<p>Hi, I'm William. <br>
								Being a Marine, I always had a passion for computers. Mainly the hardware aspect.There was always something about motherboards and cpu's that were interesting to me but I never thought about actually pursuing anything as an actual career. As a hobby I got a certification as a PC Technician but it wasn't until Pokemon Go was released in 2016 that I really got to see the software side of the I.T. world. My group that I played with wanted to utilize a Scanner so I found someone that had forked and modified one. Only catch was that you had to set all the stats and pokemon themselves. I ran that for only a few months in 2017 though just for laughs. However, later that year I found a Full Stack Java boot camp called WeCan{Code}IT that accepted the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Since January 2018, I have been an Apprentice. Feel free to check out my github projects that I had as projects so far while I learn to code.</p>
