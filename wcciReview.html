                    <p>
                        This is my first review, and while I’m not experienced in reviewing organizations, I felt compelled to share my thoughts on WeCan{Code}IT (WCCI). WCCI is an intensive 14-week bootcamp focused on full-stack web development. Unlike traditional college programs, WCCI provides a faster, more focused path into the tech industry, allowing students to acquire valuable skills without the massive financial burden of a degree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having transitioned from a Marine Rifleman (0311) into civilian life, I initially found limited career options, as many veterans tend to gravitate toward law enforcement or security roles. However, my passion for technology, video games, and electronics led me to explore the growing tech industry, where I saw countless opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By 2017, I began researching coding bootcamps, which typically range from 12 weeks to six months. While reviews were mixed, I chose WeCan{Code}IT for its accreditation and support for veterans. They also accept the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which made this decision even easier.

                    <p>The 14-week full-time bootcamp is immersive, with the first four weeks focusing on backend development (Java, Spring), followed by frontend development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript). The curriculum is rigorous, and students are expected to put in long hours. There are extra sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays for additional help, with classroom hours from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm.</p>

                    <p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is an essential part of WCCI’s curriculum, introduced around week 2. Although challenging at first, TDD helps streamline development by catching errors early. It may take longer initially, but it ultimately saves time by eliminating bugs and making debugging easier. TDD teaches the importance of building software in a smooth, efficient manner—similar to the Marine Corps adage "smooth is fast, and fast is smooth."</p>

The event offers opportunities for networking and securing job offers. After presentations, the class participates in a final "checkout" ceremony, where emotions and experiences are shared. Graduation itself is a short ceremony, followed by celebrations. Interestingly, only a few students had prior coding experience, with most coming in with no background. Despite challenges, the cohort’s growth over the 14 weeks is significant.</p>

                <p>It has been 7 months since I graduated, and many of us still stay in touch. Several people were hired at JP Morgan Chase, starting at 68k a year, while others found positions at Nationwide or IT consulting agencies. Some moved across state lines, and one guy was even hired in another Ohio city.</p>
                <p>As for me, I'm still unemployed for personal reasons and will soon be actively job hunting. Right now, I'm in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, working on this review while exploring coding with just Notepad and command line.</p>

                    <h2>Advice for Future Coding Bootcampers</h2>
                </div>
                <p>This is just some advice that I like to give to newer students and the first piece of advice is what I gave my class when the pressure started to get tough from a Military perspective. From a Marine to a Civilian:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a 14 week commitment. We all have loved ones and money will be, or may be tight while you go through these next 14 weeks. Stress will start to rise and build up as you focus on weekend projects and do some after class study. Family and Friends may start to feel distant as you will start to feel distant from them as well. I was asked how I make it through this without the worry of my loves ones and friends. Well to be honest, I am a Marine and I am used to being away. They understand that this program takes a lot of dedication and for all of you to. You are choosing to be here and you are the one who needs to study and you are the one who needs to pass your weekend projects and you are the one whose name needs to be on that certificate. This is for you and not them. You need their support and not the other way around. This might sting for some but the next 14 weeks you just have to focus on this and somewhat ignore everyone else.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be afraid to ask questions and remember that Google is your friend. Pair up on weekends. Meet up with each other at the Library, someone's home, or something. Meetup, discuss your weaknesses and strengths and learn from one another.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be that one to go at it alone. You might know what you are doing or already a pro at this and just need something tied to your name to help you get a job. Remember, you are all in this together and when you assist someone on how to do something then make sure they understand it. Just don't show them and be like it is magic. We all know that certain things work within Java because of magic but help them understand how you get to that point.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you master Git, start using these commands consistently:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>git status</code></li>
                    <li><code>git add .</code></li>
                    <li><code>git commit -m "message"</code>
                        <br><small>Note: You do not need internet access to save your commits. Once you’re ready, push the changes to GitHub.</small></li>
                    <li><code>git push</code>
                        <br><small>Note: Pushing updates your repository on GitHub. You don’t need to push every time, just when you’re ready to share your work.</small></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even if it is just silly edits like deleting or adding a white space. Commit them as it engraves those lines into muscle memory so to speak and when you commit write out a short detailed description to what you did. I remember I had to go back a lot to see if I had done something yet or screwed it up to where I needed to go back to before I screwed it up. Commiting may seem like a waste of time but as newbies practice makes perfect and the more you fail the more efficient you become!</p>
