Now, tags have been added to the mix. Each review is associated with a tag and when the User clicks on a specific tag all the reviews associated with that tag will appear.</p>

					<h3><a href="https:www.wrthompsonjr.com">GitHub Portfolio: Generation JScript</a></h3>
					<p>Now that I have been shown JavaScript, it was time to add it to my portfolio. The logo was turned into a button that would toggle between hide and show. Buttons were created to expand and collapse the descriptions for the GitHub Projects. An image carousel was added to the about me to show more than one photo. A button that showed the date and time through an event listener was also added along with with a modal for the about me description. After it was graded I completely removed it all except for the image carousel. The image posted below is what it had looked like on my Samsung Note 8 device.</p>	
					<p>Note: Jasmine was also used to try and attempt to test the JavaScript but learning Jasmine, as well as how to correctly test JavaScript is still a work in progress...</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/WillieT1986/reviews-the-next-generation">Reviews The Next Generation</a></h3>
					<p>Third iteration for Reviews Site. This time, it was required that tags be added, as well as a comment section for each review site. When user access a review from one of the two Categories, there will be a comment section to leave comments. In the picture below I left a few comments to show how it works. The one part for this project that I could not figure out was how to utilize Ajax to add and remove a tag, and to add and remove a review from a tag. Beside that, the site functions as intended. However, I realize I could have used JQuery but was trying to avoid JQuery and use only JavaScript.</p>

					<h3><a href="">Portfolio Updating</a></h3>
					<p>While visiting my fiance Xuyen in Vietnam from Nov. to Dec. 2018, I was studying along side her during some down time while also assisting her studies with the English language. This nice down time allowed me to work on my portfolio site.</p>
					<p>This site will never technally be completed as I learn new things, or become curious and will want to add future projects, as well as tweak this site as needed. Last big update was the review on WeCan{Code}IT.</p>

					<p>This was an interesting Kata from Pillar Technologies. I had about 1 week to do this and it was definitely a memory refresher. I learned new things from this Kata, as well as learned a lot of what I need to learn to boot! This Kata taught me that I need to research and learn how to work with times. As in am/pm/24h. This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/WillieT1986/greenlawn">Green Lawn Cemetery</a></h3>
					<p>I was showing my Vietnamese Fiancee around town today and decided to show her the Family Graves located in Green Lawn Cemetery. Having a hard time remembering exactly where their tombstones laid but eventually found them. As we walked by anonymous tombstones, my Fiancee found it confusing telling who's who by just what is engraved in stone. It would have been a confusing question to any other person but having visited her Family in Vietnam on a small Rice Farm it made sense to why she would ask me that.</p>	
					<p>In Vietnam, their graves are not in the ground but above ground where it has very detailed info about who lays to rest, as well as a picture of who lies there. The only time I did not see a picture were the ones probably before they had cameras in Vietnam but the earlier generations all had photos of who it was. However, I did point out that some tombstones did indeed have a picture but not all.</p>	
					<p>So it got me thinking, why not have an online database of those laid to rest in Green Lawn Cemetery? Especially with Ancestry and Genealogy on the rise.</p>
