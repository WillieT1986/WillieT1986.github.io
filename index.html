							<h2>William R Thompson Jr</h2>
							<p class="modal-content-about-me-p">Junior Software Developer</p>
							<p>Welcome, <br>
							I’m an aspiring Developer that learned to code from WeCanCodeIT, an accelerated Software Development program that teaches Full Stack Java with focus on test driven development.</p>
							<p>Served my time in the U.S. Military. I am a Marine, an 0311. When I left my beloved Corps the only thing I thought I could do was either Security or Law Enforcement. Not once did I ever think about anything else on a computer besides playing Games and building them for Games.</p>
							<p>My first experience with coding was back in High School between 2001 and 2005 where we mainly utilized HTML and CSS, and I didn’t really like it. Then again, in 2013 for my Computer Engineering Certificate, I had to take a class on C++. Again, I didn't like it. </p>
							<p>It wasn’t until 2017,  when I took some time off work to visit my Fiance in Vietnam that I researched coding bootcamps and discovered that WeCan{Code}IT took the Post 9/11 GI Bill so I applied and was accepted. I took this opportunity to continue to learn about the software side of computers and found happiness coding in Java while building my code through test driving and pair programming.</p>
