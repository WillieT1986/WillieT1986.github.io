							<p>Hi, I'm William. Being a Marine, I always had a passion for computers. Mainly the hardware aspect.There was always something about motherboards and cpu's that were interesting to me but I never thought about actually pursuing anything as an actual career. As a hobby I got a certification as a PC Technician but it wasn't until Pokemon Go was released in 2016 that I really got to see the software side of the I.T. world. My group that I played with wanted to utilize a Scanner so I found someone that had forked and modified one. Only catch was that you had to set all the stats and pokemon themselves. I ran that for only a few months in 2017 though just for laughs. However, later that year I found a Full Stack Java boot camp called WeCan{Code}IT that accepted the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Since January 2018, I have been an Apprentice. Feel free to check out my github projects that I had as projects so far while I learn to code.</p>

					<p>If you like cats then feel free to check out my Instagram of my cat Tara and I. Probably one of the most well behaved cats that I have seen and goes for walks.</p>					
					<p>Please feel free to check out my Github accout. There is a Github link below here, as well as direct links to my 3 listed projects and if you're active on LinkedIn then please connect and give me advice. I'm completely open to criticism and advice. That is the only other way for me to learn.</p>

					<p id="toggleProj2" style="display: none">My version of the late 90's Tamagachi and my second project from after two weeks of learning Java and being introdced to unit testing. Here we have Hold the dog with some simple stats 
					of hunger, water, waste, bored amd tiredness. However, the stats will affect one another. For example, when you feed Hold the water drops. When you play with Hold, his bored will drop but tireness will raise. </p>

					<button onclick="expandButton3()">Expando Collapso</button>
					<p id="toggleProj3" style="display: none">After 4 weeks of learning Java, this project combined all that was learned within a 4 week time frame. Taking virtual-pet from week 2 and recreated it using not just a single pet but a multitude of pets like Dogs, Cats and Robot Dogs inside a Shelter. User has to feed and water the Dogs and Cats, as well as waste clean up created by each dog when prompted to. The Cats, there's a Shelter litter box which has a counter that resets to 0 when the User decides to clean the litter box. Other features include the intake and outake of pets. Best of all, the User has the ability to see a list of each pet and their stats at all times. </p>
