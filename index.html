					<h2>Apprentice Software Developer</h2>
					<p>Hi, I'm William. Being a Marine, I always had a passion for computers. Mainly the hardware aspect.
						There was always something about motherboards and cpu's that were interesting to me but I never thought about 
						actually pursuing anything as an actual career. As a hobby I got a certification as a PC Technician but it wasn't 
						until Pokemon Go was released in 2016 that I really got to see the software side of the I.T. world. My group that I played
						with wanted to utilize a Scanner so I found someone that had forked and modified one. Only catch was that you had to 
						set all the stats and pokemon themselves. I ran that for only a few months in 2017 though just for laughs. 
						However, later that year I found a Full Stack Java boot camp called WeCan{Code}IT that accepted the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
						Since January 2018, I have been an Apprentice. Feel free to check out my github projects that I had as projects so far while
					I learn to code.</p>
