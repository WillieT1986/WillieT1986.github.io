            <p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,
                and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
                application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
                platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled
                to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. <a

            <p>Directly from Maven, Maven, a Yiddish word meaning accumulator of knowledge, began as an attempt to simplify the build processes in the Jakarta Turbine project. There were several projects, each with their own Ant build files, that were all slightly different. JARs were checked into CVS. We wanted a standard way to build the projects, a clear definition of what the project consisted of, an easy way to publish project information, and a way to share JARs across several projects. <a href="https://maven.apache.org/index.html">Source</a><br>
                <br>The result is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project. We hope that we have created something that will make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project.

            <p>You must begin by writing a unit test for the functionality that you intend to write. But by rule 2, you
                can't write very much of that unit test. As soon as the unit test code fails to compile, or fails an
                assertion, you must stop and write production code. But by rule 3 you can only write the production code
                that makes the test compile or pass, and no more. <a

            <h3 id="oop">Object Oriented Programming - OOP</h3>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may
                contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures,
                often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify
                the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or
                "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one
                another. There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular ones are class-based,
                meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their type. <a

            <h3 id="html">HTML5</h3>
            <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the
                fifth and current major version of the HTML standard. It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide
                Web Consortium (W3C) to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it
                both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web
                browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2
                HTML. </p>
            <p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends,
                improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application
                programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a
                candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered
                devices in mind. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">Source</a></p>

            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side,

            <p>JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
                trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
                programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and uses. <a

            <h3 id="ajax">Ajax</h3>
            <p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest
                object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including
                JSON, XML, HTML, and text files. AJAX’s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature,
                which means it can communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to
                refresh the page.</p>
            <p>The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following:</p>
            <p> 1. Make requests to the server without reloading the page.</p>
            <p> 2. Receive and work with data from the server</p>
