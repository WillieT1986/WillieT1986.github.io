					<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
					<p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Source</a></p>

					<p>1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</p>
					<p>2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.</p>
					<p>3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.</p>
					<p>You must begin by writing a unit test for the functionality that you intend to write. But by rule 2, you can't write very much of that unit test. As soon as the unit test code fails to compile, or fails an assertion, you must stop and write production code. But by rule 3 you can only write the production code that makes the test compile or pass, and no more. <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">Source</a></p>

					<h3 id="oop">Object Oriented Programming - OOP</h3>
					<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Source</a></p>

					<h3 id="sql">Structured Query Language - SQL</h3>
					<p>Is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). In comparison to older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM, SQL offers two main advantages:</p>
					<p>First, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command.</p>
					<p>Second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.</p>

					<h3 id="spring">Spring MVC</h3>
					<p>The Spring Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework is designed around a DispatcherServlet that dispatches requests to handlers, with configurable handler mappings, view resolution, locale and theme resolution as well as support for uploading files. </p>
					<p>The default handler is based on the @Controller and @RequestMapping annotations, offering a wide range of flexible handling methods. With the introduction of Spring 3.0, the @Controller mechanism also allows you to create RESTful Web sites and applications, through the @PathVariable annotation and other features.</p>

					<p>The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database. JPA was defined as part of the EJB 3.0 specification as a replacement for the EJB 2 CMP Entity Beans specification. JPA is now considered the standard industry approach for Object to Relational Mapping (ORM) in the Java Industry. <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_JPA%3F">Source</a></p>

					<p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js.</p>
					<p>JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and uses. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript">Source</a></p>

					<h3 id="ajax">Ajax</h3>
					<p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files. AJAX’s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page.</p>
					<p>The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following:</p>
					<p>  1. Make requests to the server without reloading the page.</p>
					<p>  2. Receive and work with data from the server</p>
