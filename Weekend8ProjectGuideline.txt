Professional Portfolio with JS

Overview
Upgrade your professional portfolio to include JS content. (No frameworks.)

Tasks
All requirements from iteration one of this project should still be there. You are encouraged to make a multi page site this time around.

Additions to your site
- Add an image carousel. This can be a carousel of screenshots of your projects (perhaps they link to your projects)
- Add a button in your navigation that will toggle the visibility of your actual site navigation.
- Add a button and collapsable description to your portfolio projects so when the user clicks the button the descriptions expand and collapse
- Create a modal box that pops up with your bio information whenever a button or link is pressed

Stretch Goals
- Change layout with media queries based on viewport width. Feel free to use other specific media rules but base media queries should be based on viewport width. (Most common)
- Have the dropdown navigation menu only when at smaller viewports and the full navigation when at larger viewports


Tips
- Remember to look at Stack Overflow and Google problems when you have them.
- Mozilla Developer Network: JavaScript
